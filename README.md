- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- JavaScript

### What I learned

While building this page, I learned some small (but significant) layout tricks involving linear gradients and SVG assets. For example, the background for the email-box section above the footer uses a linear gradient to create the effect that it's part of the footer. In my previous project, I made a similar container part of the footer and just offset it X pixels upward to create the 'displaced' effect. I think this solution is much better and makes the sections easier to work with when adding more styles or content later.
